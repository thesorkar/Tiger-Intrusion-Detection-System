							<p> As the involvement of the systems over the internet
increasing rapidly, the security concerns have also
seen. The proposed approach deals with the detection
of intruders over the internet efficiently. The
proposed algorithm has performed well as compared
to the previously applied algorithms such as SVM,
Na√Øve Bayes, and Decision Tree. The detection rates
and the false error rates can be improved at a great
extent by the proposed approach. The dataset used
here is the knowledge discovery dataset. The results
obtained by our proposed method having the values
for Performance time (min)is 3.24 minutes, Accuracy
rate (%) is 96.78 %, and the Error rate (%) is 0.21 %.</p>
